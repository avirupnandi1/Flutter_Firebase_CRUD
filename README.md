Here's a sample README file for your Flutter Firebase CRUD project:

# Flutter Firebase CRUD

A sample Flutter application that demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Firebase Firestore.

## Description

This Flutter application demonstrates how to perform basic CRUD operations on Firebase Firestore, a NoSQL document database. Users can add new documents, view existing documents, update documents, and delete documents. The application uses the [cloud_firestore](https://pub.dev/packages/cloud_firestore) package to interact with Firestore and the [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) package to manage state.

## Screenshots
